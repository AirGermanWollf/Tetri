# Tetri
Basic tetris game programmed in MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)

Instructions of how to run and play the game are in Spanish. Additional comments on the operation of the code, in the code (forgive the redundancy).

I hope you like it and that be useful for future projects. If you use part of the code, I would love you to give me some credit in your bibliography :D
